  @atbd, thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, my laptop has a buggy uefi
  implementation and all available UEFI solutions didn't work for me. Thus, I
  sticked with mbr. It's a toshiba laptop from late 2013 and has both BIOS/uefi.
  Although I'm able to boot using UEFI, boot time increases dramatically because
  of the buggy firmware telling me that no bootable media found (lasts for like
  5 seconds) then proceeds to boot properly. Thanks for stopping by though
