  Having done what you recommend, it seems that now it works for me and now
  bbswitch seems to be working, my nvidia card goes out. I'm going to follow
  your web closely, it helped me a lot with bumblebee and with the guide
  intel-ucode, congratulations for your great work and thank you very much.
