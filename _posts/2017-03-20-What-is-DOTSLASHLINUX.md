As most of you are wondering, ./LINUX is a new website on the web, aside from that it's a website about all the cool stuff that you can do with a GNU/Linux distro.
<br>
<br>

I'll be discussing all that there's to optimizing a GNU/Linux distro, starting from the bios (hopefully) and moving our way up to userspace going through the bootloader, initial RAM disk, the kernel (... and yes I got a life thank you...), the TTYs, the shells, window-managers, terminal emulators, desktop managers, panels and all sorts of these cool stuff!
<br>
<br>

What's awesome about GNU/Linux is that once you've got accustomed to a certain setup, you can backup your configuration (your "/home" perhaps) and apply it (most of the times) wherever and whenever you please, as long as there's a linux kernel down there! That's why ./LINUX was created.
<br>
<br>

I'll be discussing the pros/cons of almost every single option you have to go through when optimizing a distro, choosing your favorite apps and alot more... Think about it: <strong>minimal overhead</strong>, <strong>small memory footprints</strong>, <strong>low temperatures</strong> and <strong>high performance</strong>! Isn't that awesome?!!
<br>
<br>

But doesn't that mean that I'll be pretty much neglecting userspace, convenience and productivity??!! Well, at first it may be time consuming for those who're doing it on their own;therefore, on ./LINUX you'll get the real results about what to pick. And NO, I never said I'm ignoring userspace and conveniency. In fact it's quite the opposite!
<br>
<br>

Userspace apps and tools will be given a special care to help our readers achieve their dream distro fine-tuned to their utmost liking!
<br>
<br>

One thing to note is that, this website was created by me (Firas Khalil Khana) and it represents my sole opinion. Everything mentioned here be it a link, a website, an app...etc, has my utmost respect.
